Test script for verifying PPO agent fixes.

IMPORTANT: Before running this script, you need to:
1. Clone the Lux environment: git clone https://github.com/Lux-AI-Challenge/Lux-Design-S3.git
2. Install the environment: pip install luxai_s3==0.2.1

This is setup you would need to do in your Colab environment.

"""
# First, set up environment (this would happen in Colab):
!git clone https://github.com/Lux-AI-Challenge/Lux-Design-S3.git
!pip install luxai_s3==0.2.1

# Then, initialize the agent and run it:
import os
os.environ['XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_PREALLOCATE'] = 'false'
import jax
from luxai_s3.env import LuxAIS3Env
from luxai_s3.params import EnvParams
from simple_transformer import SimplePPOAgent

    num_minibatches=1,
    num_envs=1,
    num_steps=5,  # Only 5 steps
    env_params=env_params
)

# Run a quick training iteration

print("\nThe key fixes implemented:")
print("1. Use REAL observations in training (not dummy zeros)")
print("2. Handle all units instead of just the first one")
print("3. Include both action components in training")
print("4. Generate separate actions for each player")
print("5. Pass environment parameters correctly")
print("6. Added error handling for stability during testing")

print("\nThese changes address all the major issues identified.")
